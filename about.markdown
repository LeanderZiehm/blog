My tech stack: TypeScript, Node.js, Fastify, Postgres, and Linux.

I focus on full-stack web development, leaning backend. My current focus is on mastering TypeScript and JavaScript at a deep, language-level understanding so I can build robust, secure, and performant production-grade web applications. I’m especially interested in backend architecture, performance, debugging and troubleshooting, logging, and database-driven systems, with a strong emphasis on PostgreSQL. I enjoy building web apps, admin panels, and dashboards with the ability to carry my own weight in front-end React and Angular when there are no other front-end developers around. Furthermore, I value real depth in understanding the fundamental technologies.
